## Current Solutions

Pill Organizers, Reminder Apps, In-person Caretaker/Medecine management services <br /><br />
Flaws of these are:
- Too complicated, lack of essential features, no consideration for diverse demographic like senior users.
- Not user friendly/accessible
- All pills in the app look the same, No database of pills (manual input), Limited customization.
